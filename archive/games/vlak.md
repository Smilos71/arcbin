# Vlak (Train)

Vlak is a legendary Czech puzzle game developed by Miroslav Němeček in 1993. You control a small locomotive and your goal is to collect all objects on the screen (cars, hearts, diamonds) to open the exit to the next level. As you collect items, your train gets longer, making navigation increasingly difficult.
